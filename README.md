# NHL Data Pipeline

This project implements a data pipeline for processing NHL game and player data using the NHL API.

---

## **Features**
- **Data Cleaning**: Load, clean, and validate data from CSV files.
- **API Integration**: Fetch updated game and player data from the NHL API.
- **Data Updates**: Append or update data in existing CSV files based on input parameters.
- **DAG Implementation**: Organize processes using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure.
- **Exception Handling**: Retry mechanisms and error logging for robust execution.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nhl-data-pipeline.git
cd nhl-data-pipeline
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Pipeline
To process a list of game IDs and update the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python src/dag_pipeline.py
Example
Modify the dag_pipeline.py script to include game IDs to process:
python
Copy code
game_ids = ["2023020001", "2023020002"]
Run the pipeline:
bash
Copy code
python src/dag_pipeline.py
Check the output: The pipeline updates the CSV files in the data/ folder with new data fetched from the NHL API.
Demonstration
Below is a demonstration of how the pipeline works:

Input
Sample game IDs: ["2023020001", "2023020002"]
Original CSV files in the data/ folder.
Execution
Run the command:

bash
Copy code
python src/dag_pipeline.py
Process
The pipeline:
Loads existing data from data/ files.
Fetches updated game data for the specified game IDs from the NHL API.
Cleans and validates the data.
Appends or updates the datasets.
Outputs the updated files back into the data/ folder.
Output
Updated data/game_overview.csv and other relevant files.
New records are added, and existing records are updated based on the input game IDs.
Example Output
Before: data/game_overview.csv:

csv
Copy code
gameID,team,score
2023020001,TOR,2
After: data/game_overview.csv:

csv
Copy code
gameID,team,score
2023020001,TOR,2
2023020002,BOS,4
Future Improvements
Enhanced Validation:
Integrate schema validation for stricter data quality checks.

Containerization:
Package the pipeline in a Docker container for portability.

Scalability:
Use distributed processing for larger datasets or higher workloads.

### Key Changes
1. **Single continuous format**: The entire document flows without breaking sections unnecessarily.
2. **Consistent Markdown formatting**: Headings, code blocks, and lists follow the same style throughout.
3. **Readable structure**: All sections connect logically.

You can now copy and paste this content directly into your `README.md` file without any issues. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
